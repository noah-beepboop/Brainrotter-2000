Makes focusing on work easier.
<br> Overlays lots of video clips onto your screen to keep you visually stimulated.

<br>In order to use it download and extract the latest release zip file and add some video files to the folder.
<br> After that just follow the instructions when you run the program.
<br> I would also recommend using something like windows powertoys to make sure that the videos are always on top.

unfortunately no audio support :(
